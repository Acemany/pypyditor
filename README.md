# pypyditor

At first I was going to write a simple text editor, but then I started writing a compiler function, Mlog to Python, and thought "what if I combine them"?
And I did. And recently I saw the repository with the opposite of my little function, pyndustric, and wanted to add it to my text editor.
Now, when they both work properly when separated, I can REALLY take that heap and make a multi-language mlog IDE. Maybe.
